# Covid19-Analysis
## 1. Life Expectancy in Mid 20th Century and Covid-19 Death Rates. 
The research tries to explain the variation in observed Covid-19 deaths in low and high-income countries. I posit that due to low life expectancy at birth in low income countries, people with underlining health condition who would have otherwise died from Covid-19 have already passed on from other life-threatening illness. 

The high rate of Covid-19 deaths observed in high income countries result from a shock in the health care system that renders countries incapable of continuously sustaining those with such heath conditions.
